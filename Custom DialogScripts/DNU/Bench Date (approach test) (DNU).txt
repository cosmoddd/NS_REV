This is quite a night.
	Person A
Are you worried you'll run into some old work colleages.
	Person B
Not really.  I could care less about them, or the company.
	Person A
...
	Person B
OK, maybe I'm a little worried.
	Person A
No one ever leaves a company like that.
	Person B
I did.  I walked away.
	Person A
I know, that was really brave of you.
	Person B
Or stupid, depending on who you ask.
	Person A
Brave.  I think it as brave.  And here we are.
	Person B
Yeah, but where to next?
	Person A
Take things a day at a time.  
	Person B
Hmmm...
