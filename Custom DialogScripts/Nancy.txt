We have all these people in for the conference this weekend...
Do we have enough food in the pantry?
Do we have enough hands in the kitchen for room service?
What if we lose hot water again?
What if the air conditioner breaks again?
What if someone falls asleep drunk in the hot tub again?
What if there's an incident down at High End Ruminations again?
What if Clem gives up his residency?
What if Bruce starts playing Corkscrew again?
???????????
