//Blue Moose Man stares out the window

It's devious what DJ Bogart acheived.
And the fact that he acheived it here, in Norwood's old estate.
Most of his fans don't realize the throughline.
They're too busy having their faces melted.
And as long as they buy our product, that's all fine.
Man, I could use a dip in the jacuzzi...

A jacuzzi session could take the edge off for tomorrow.
Sadly I left my swim trunks back in the city.
I'm going to be out of my depth at this meeting tomorrow.
I'd prefer that the Norwood Hotel remain its own entity.
Hopefully the flow of our new Peach Sand flavor will sway opinion.
Some poeple don't know what they have until they lose it.

Thanks so much, I really needed a swim.
I usually don't go down there without my favorite beverage.
And no, it's not what you're thinking.
I keep a case of Pluny the Older in my private chiller in the kitchen.
I get it hand-delivered from the west coast in an ice-box.

Here's the key.  Why don't you go grab it for me.
I promise you'll have free Blue Moose for a year.
I'll be down by the jacuzzi.
This might be my weekend here, after all...

Whatever.  I'm in a jacuzzi.
Nothing special.
