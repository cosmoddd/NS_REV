Hello, once more, friend.
I see you continue to move in unexpected directions.
I thought this room was permanently off-limits.
That's why I've been holing up here.
The Norwood always had a place for the likes of me.

So you need a costume for the club, huh?
Mo is notoriously picky about who he lets in.
You'll need to do a thorough job of making a good costume.
Slick shoes for dancing, 
Outrageous pants,
Counter-balanced by a formal shirt,
A singular intimidating necklace, 
A devious mask to hide yoru true identity,
A tall hat to elevate your height,
A monocle, so you can see others' true motives, 
...and definitely some fake facial hair, so people will think you're older than you are.
The costume mannequin for putting this all together is up the ladder in Norwood's walk-in armoire.
Other guests do have pieces of some sort of costume, but none of them seem interested in DJ Bogart's style.
Pity them.
Hmmm...

Years ago, DJ Bogart said I could send him my music.
That was when he still played to a room full of three people.
I was one of them.
Me, Bernice and Jags.  
Now, he plays to thirty thousand.
Let's just say I'm finally calling in the favor.
