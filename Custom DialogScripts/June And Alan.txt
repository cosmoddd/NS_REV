//June and Alan Miranda stand at the edge of the lobby
BEGIN
	Alan
It's good to have a regimen.
	June
You don't have to tell me, dad.
I always honor my clients' deadlines. 
	Alan
I thought you were coming here to finish your string quartet?
	June
The agency called today.
They need five versions of "Happy Mouth" by Sunday. 
	Alan
What do they want with that awful song?
	June
It's for Saturn Noodles Birthday-Cake Ramen campaign.
	Alan
What a shame.
	Pause 5
	June
I mean, money is money and I can't really say no.
	Alan
Are you using sheet music?
	Pause 3
	June
Computer, as ever.
	Pause 5
	Alan
You're always so expressive when you write away from the computer.
	June
Stop.  I feel bad enough I left mine back at the apartment.
	Pause 3
I'll see if they have any here.
	Pause 5
This place, there's bound to be some loose sheet music floating around.
	Alan
I worry you don't take enough time for your own self expression.
	Pause 3
	June
Stop worrying, Dad.
BREAK
	June
How's it going with the conference preparation?
	Alan
Dreadful.
	June
How can you say that?  Isn’t this, like, your home court, environmental science?
	Alan
The organization I'm going up against...
They know me too well and they’ve been preparing.  
Far more than I can afford to.  
The acquisition of the Norwood Hotel is an inevitability to them.
	June
So it’s just you standing in their way, eh?
	Alan
A lot of regulative red-tape is standing in their way.
The Modulo Group can afford to slice its way through it.
But I have an ace up my sleeve.  
	June
Isn’t that what you always say?
	Alan
This one's a doozy, though.
It could have serious reprcussions for everyone involved.
	June
Like what?
	Alan
You know I can't tell you.
	June
Could it stop Title 3 from passing?
	Alan
I wish I knew, June.
BREAK
	June
You want to take a walk?  By the tennis courts?
	Alan
I'm gonna need to go over some charts, at least for the next few hours.
	June
Not even a little stroll?
	Alan
June... not this time.  After the conference tomorrow.
	June
But aren't you in a debrief til Sunday?
	Alan
Then we can go after that.
	June
I guess I'll just grind away at Happy Mouth.
	Alan
Try to fill in the margins with some of your own work.
	June
It would be easy if I had some music paper to write on...
