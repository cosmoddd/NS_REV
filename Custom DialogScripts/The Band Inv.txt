Miracles really do happen.

Miracle of miracles!

You should come up to our room.  Room 11.
We're gonna read over this together.

You can read over it all you want, I'm gonna read... other stuff.

I need something to keep my fingers occupied for this tour.
Any recommendations?

Careful, Jeremy.  Don't work yourself into a bout of tendonitis.

I'm writing a new song about apples.
	HT
	Mike Looks At Dave
	Mike
How long is it?
	HT
	Dave Looks At Mike
Twenty minutes.
	Mike
A song about apples doesn't need to be twenty minutes long, Dave.
	Dave
Apples are an important part of my dietary life.
They deserve a tone poem.
	HT
	Jeremy Looks At Dave
	Jeremy
I'm sure they do.  
But the first ten minutes can't just be you playing scales.
	HT
	Dave Looks At Jeremy
	Dave
Scales, like apples, are simple and beautiful.  
	Mike
This song sucks already.
	HT
	Jeremy Looks At Mike
	Jeremy
I wouldn't be so quick to judge.
Perhaps Dave has finally figured out his concept.
	HT
	Mike Looks At Jeremy
	Mike
Nope.
	Dave
You might want to hear my song first.

	Mike Looks At Dave
	Mike
Remember that song about grits?
	Dave
Yeah, I worked on that for months.
	Mike
Thirty minutes of arpeggios.
	Dave
What's wrong with arpeggios?
	Jeremy
The way you tucked in the part about the grits at the end there...
	Dave
Okay guys, I get it.  No apple ballad this weekend.
	Mike
I'm just saying, try getting to the point faster.
	HT
	Dave Looks At Mike
	Dave
Not every song is 3 minutes, mister miniatures.
	Mike
Dude, look at our Soundmist stats.
After thirty seconds, the listeners click on something else.
We're lucky if we have them for a minute or more.
	Jeremy
I think we should start writing minute-long songs. max.
	Mike
Me, too.
	Dave
Peter Norwood's peices were long and people listented to them.
	Mike
Norwood's pieces were good.
	Jeremy
Norwood's pieces got to the point faster, I'm afraid.
	Dave
Norwood would have been down with my approach.
	Mike
Why don't you play him a sample when you see him?
	Jeremy
Ok, that's enough, Mike... 
	Dave
You guys suck.
