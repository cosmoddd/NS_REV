My father practically grew up here.
His mother, my grandmother, would stay every summer,
From 1934 to about 1968. 
Sweating out one of Peter's extremely diffucult etudes.
She was in his circle.  
No air conditioning. 
Peter yelling at everyone.
Good times.

I don't really mind that I wasn't able to inherit my father's talents.
It's almost like he soaked them all up.
And absorbed them, leaving nothing to give back.
My grandmother, on the other hand...
She was generous with her gifts.
She taught my father how to play the harp, with Peter's encouragement.
But when I was younger, my father wouldn't let me play a damn thing.
In light of what's happened in recent times, I guess it was a prescient decision.

Peter Norwood gets a reputation for being tempestuous.
But really he just had high standards.
My father, in his professional life, had to suffer a lot of fools after Norwood disappeared.
If only he'd posessed an ounce of the fire Norwood posessed.

I'm not really supposed to tell anyone this, 
but I have to confess:
I've been summoned to be a part of a panel.
At this Title 3 hearing tomorrow.
I just want this to be a clean, fair, no-nonsense meeting.
I'll give both sides a fair shake, 
but then I'm getting the hell back to Yonksville with my dad.
It was a nice stay, 
but this place is too much for either of us.
