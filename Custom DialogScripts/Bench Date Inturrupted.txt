You're actually going to give that to DJ Bogart, huh?

That's how it starts, Hans.
An established artist takes a promising one under their wing.

I'll bet DJ Bogart gets a lot of demos, though.

But none of them sound like whatever this stranger's got.

Hey I think I've seen you from somewhere.

You need to actually start wearing your helmet, Hans.
This is a dangerous sport.

I drink a lot of Blue Moose and I know they're the sponsors.

	Person A
I used to drink that stuff a lot when I worked at the Modulo Group.
	Person B
It fueled many late night study sessions for me.
	Person A
It made me perfectly functional on four hours of sleep.
	Person B
Just the sight of it brings me back to Ernst Library.
