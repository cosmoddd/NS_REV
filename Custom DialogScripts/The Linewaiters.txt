How long has it been?
	Linewaiter 2
Two hours.
	Linewaiter 1
You know we were told it was costume-only, right?
	Linewaiter 2
I was also told DJ Bogart does that from time-to-time to thin out the crowd.
	Linewaiter 1
"False cancelling."  Isn't that just a rumour?
	Linewaiter 2
Three months ago, my cousin tried to get in.  It was supposedly "cancelled."
She went anyway.  It definitely wasn't cancelled. 
She had the best night of her life. 
	Linewaiter 1
I mean, it's not like I can't hear music coming through those doors.
	Linewaiter 2
I know, right?  I think it's worth holding out.
	Linewaiter 1
Considering how long it took us to get out here, we don't really have a choice.
	Linewaiter 2
So close, Arthur...
	Linewaiter 1
So close...
