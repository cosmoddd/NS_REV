I don't know, Ba, this is a strange choice.

Gotta have faith in the Boardwalk Assasin, Avery.
This is the wind-up.
He's going to drop a track that connects all the dots, shortly.
I promise.
	Huamn 1
There's nothing but dots in this set.  Connect, please!
	Human 2
I gotta vent: there's too many people looking over at his vinyl.
	Human 1
Those fools.  
	Human 2
They think they can just take a look, go to Shani's Records and boom.
They're DJs now.
	Human 1
In the year 20-whatever and everybody wants to be a DJ.
	Human 2
It's the year 20-whatever and everybody wants to be a producer.
	Human 1
People take pride in what they have no hand in.
The Boardwalk Assasin uses special software.  
Blanks out the tracks as soon as they load on the screen.
	Human 2
DJ Bogart peels all the labels off his vinyl.
Replaces them with stickers that have his secret code.  
	Human 1
Some fool nabbed one of his records.
At a particularly crowded party.
Not a few months ago.
Posted online, they say it's pointless to decode.
	Human 2
Just pictures of deers and owls and cows.
	Human 1
The rip sure did sound good, but who feels it now?
	Human 2
I'm caught in the grip of the city.
	Human 1
Madness.
