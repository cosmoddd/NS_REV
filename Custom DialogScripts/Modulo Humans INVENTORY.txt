I'm heading to the bar.  You coming, Lucy?
	Human 1
In a bit.  I still haven't really checked out the grounds here.
	Human 2
I know this place like the back of my hand.  I'll give you a tour.
	Human 1
I like getting lost and finding my own way.  
	Human 2
Ok, Miss Solitary Sojourn.  See you at the bar.
	Human 1
See you...

I didn't order the apple single.
It's Blue Moose I want.
Man, this apple isn't even sliced.
What kind of ship is Nadia running here?
	Human 1
We appreciate the gesture, but...
We'll order a pie or something later.

Want me to get us some vanilla ice cream?
Whipped cream, chocolate sprinkles?
I got it all in my cooler.

Amateur apple hour over here.

What are you, a rep from the People's Flea-Market?
I wouldn't even put that in my garage.
	HT

	Human 1
I think it looks fine, Courtney.
Maybe as a lawn ornament.
	HT
	Human 2 looks at Human 1
	Human 2
Sure, as an addition to my croquet set.
For when I miss a shot and need to release some tension.

The Hotel Norwood serves their guests anywhere on the grounds, Lucy.

Could you bring us a case of Blue Moose?  I'm parched.
	HT

You know you could get us in trouble for harassing other guests, Courtney.
	Human 2
Nonsense.  
	HT

	Human 2
Blue Moose, please!
But just so we're clear, the Modulo Group is *not* tipping staff this weekend.
Any issues and you can take it up with Nadia.
	HT
	Human 1 looks at Human 2
	Human 1
You worked out a no-tipping policy with Nadia?
	HT
	Human 2 looks at Human 1
	Human 2
I think it's important that the transition starts pre-emptively.
	Human 1
You're really that confident about this board meeting, huh?
	HT

And I'll be even more confident if I get some Blue Moose in my gullet.

Here's the key.
The hotel gives me a lot of knick-knacks, since I've been staying here often.
You're welcome to whatever you find in the stash.  
Just grab that flask and meet us at the bar.

Well, isn't that nice you were able to 'acquire' your own parking pass.
	HT

	Human 1
Come on, Simon.  Ours are on the company dime, you know that.
	HT
	Human 2 looks at Human 1
	Human 2
Well isn't it great, being part of a company that pays for everything?
	Human 1
Yeah, sure.
	Human 2
It's like dancing with a bee's nest, never having to worry about being stung.
	Human 1
People do that?
	Human 2
I'm actually doing it next saturday if you want to join my bees' nest dancing class.
	Human 1
What's your problem, Simon?
	HT
	Human 2 looks at You
	Human 2
I don't like when some stranger waves their parking pass in my face like its a badge of honor.

What do you have against parking passes?

When I was 13, I had to park my dad's dry-cleaning delivery truck in a lot seventeen stories deep.
It was in one of those skyscrapers downtown they had just finished building.
It was so new that the builders hadn't put directional signs anywhere in the lot.
	Human 1
I did a term paper on the contractors back then.  Scandal after scandal.  
	HT
	Human 2 looks at You
	Human 2
Well I got lost trying to find the elevator.
Eventually the meter ran out.
With no cell service, my folks thought I'd been kidnapped or something.
	HT
	Human 2 looks at Human 1
	Human 2
From what I'm told, the police found me the next morning.
They found me passed out, my arms around a traffic cone.
I got grounded for a month and my allowance took a hit.
	Human 1
Sorry to hear that, Simon.  
	Human 2
Needless to say, I still get a little touchy around parking permits.
	Human 1
Just a little?
	Human 2
Yeah, just a fucking little.

I read a big expose' in GetConnected the other week.

You really buy into all their alarmist malarkey?
	Human 2
Every monday at noon, soon as it comes on my news feed.
	Human 1
How can you use any consumer product knowing GetConnected is going to eventually do a hit piece on all of them?
	Human 2
Well, I don't use security-related consumer products, Bernice.    
	Human 1
You code your own alarm system from scratch, then?  Build your own cameras?
Set up an infrared system on the roof of your apartment?
	Human 2
Much simpler than that.  I literally have numerical padlocks on everything I own, each requiring a ten numeral code.  
Transferring my memorization skills from the Group into my security system...
That's something you'd do well to study, Bernice.
	Human 1
I'll think about it.  So not into actual keys then, either?
	Human 2
I always lose them.
