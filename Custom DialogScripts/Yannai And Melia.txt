Nothing you say is going to sway me, Belinda.
	Yannai
Shelly, we need to call it a night.  You haven't slept in days.
	Melia
If you knew the pressure I was under...
	Yannai
I do know the pressure you're under and I still think you need to call it a night.
	Melia
I need to have a coherent stance tomorrow.
	Yannai
You're fine.  The board will side with us, clearly.
	Melia
I think a little historical perspective on this place could ground my arguments.
	Yannai
You want me to see if the library has anything?
	Melia
No, I need your moral support.
	Yannai
You're that uncertain?  This hearing is practically a formality for us.
	Melia
Between the emails I'm getting...
and the fact that Alan Miranda is in the next room...
	Yannai
Don't worry about him.  Let's just figure out how to get you the info you need.
	Melia
So I can finally get a night's rest...
BREAK
	Melia
Miranda famously never loses hearings like these.
Even when the evidence is stacked against him.
He wins over the deciders with some kind of crazy angle.
	Yannai
I read the transcript Bruno and Joe's case. 
Prime waterfront real estate property.  
	Melia
Everyone thought that place was history.  
But then Miranda gave this impassioned argument about fried clams.
Totally flipped the comittee from No to Yes.  To a man.  
To this day, that place is still stinking up the waterfront.
	Yannai
That's why having some historical context on this place might be useful. 
	Melia
Hmmm...
BREAK
	Melia
You were going to play z-tennis tomorrow morning, right?
	Yannai
Where there's a court, I always play.
	Melia
Great.  I think Alan plays in the morning as well.  
See if you can get on the court with him.  
Mixed doubles.
	Yannai
What's that got to do with the hearing?
	Melia
Don't worry about that.  Just... play him in some mixed doubles.  
See how it goes.  
	Yannai
I don't know how all this fits...
	Melia
Trust me, you'll have done me a huge favor.
	Yannai
For my z-tennis skills, eh?  
	Melia
For your z-tennis skills.  
Precisely.
