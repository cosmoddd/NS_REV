	Person A
We should have never taken that left, Margie.
	Person B
Yeah, 40 miles later and where the hell are we?
	Person A
I think this is the Norwood Hotel.
	Person B
Really?  This place?
	Person A
You don't usually seem so surprised.
	Person B
Oh, it's just that I read about it in my Humanities courses.
Multiple readings.  Multiple teachers.
This was an answer to several quizzes I barely passed back then.
	Pause 3
	Person A
Well here it is.  It's even marked here on my map, a big black star.
	Person B
How old is that map?
	Person A
Maybe twenty years?
	Person B
Figures.  We should get a room.
	Person A
I don't think we could afford to stay here.
	Person B
Hans, this is not the time to be frugal.  It's late!
	Person A
You don't understand.  This place is... 
Not the kind of place you just get a room.
	Person B
Look, I'm sorry we stayed at that one hotel that charged by the hour, ok?
	Person A
I forgave you for that already.
Bottom line, this place is too expensive for us.
	Person B
A year ago you wouldn't have said that.
	Person A
A year ago I couldn't have taken bike trips like this.
I'd still be at the office.
	Person B
You keep trying to convince yourself you did the right thing.
	Person A
Five years I gave to the Modulo Group.
	Person B
Not a terribly long time.
	Person A
It felt twice as long.
But when I quit, people kept asking 'are you really sure?'.
	Person B
You said you felt bad that they just couldn't accept it.
	Person A
They struggled with the idea that someone could leave voluntarily.
	Person B
Are you going to seek out a new gig soon?
	Person A
I know I've been reluctant.
My whole financial picture is modest, I know.
	Person B
You had to sell your turntables to pay rent last month.
	Person A
I barely used them.  
And this time away from that whole environment has been very...
It's opened me up in a lot of ways.
	Person B
You can always go back to school.
We can pretend we met in college.
	Person A
Let's not go down that road again.
I'm still decompressing from my time at the Modulo Group.
And the truth is... I think they're all here.  
	Person B
Who, your ex-colleagues?  
	Person A
They're on a business trip.
Fact-finding.
	Person B
Up at the Norwood Hotel?  
I heard they were planning an expansion but... here?
	Person A
Yeah.  Coincidence, huh?
	Person B
Hans, you can't seem to get away from your old work.
We take these long rides to clear your head
and you're right back where you started.
	Person A
I know, I can't run away from myself.
But there's something else.
	Person B
Yes?
	Person A
We might be able to catch DJ Bogart spinning records.
He's down in the basement. 
	Person B
I'm not one for dancing, Hans.
	Person A
It's cheaper than sleeping.
And this is a very special event tonight. 
I mean, it's DJ Bogart!
	Person B
I'm surprised there aren't bodyguards guards swarming the place.
The guy is a lightning rod.
That AV set he played at the Circus...
	Person A
DJ Bogart is always in total control.
He doesn't incite the crowd, he reflects their uncertainties, he educates.
	Person B
His shows attract the wrong crowd.
	Person A
His shows attract a necessary crowd.
	Person B
Necessary for what?
	Person A
You'll find out.  Shall we head up?
	Person B
What about your colleauges at the Modulo Group?
	Person A
Honestly, once I hit that dancefloor, nothing else matters.
I'm getting the wind back in my sails, let's go.
	Person B
Um, I just want to check one thing on the map...
	Person A
Clock's ticking, Margie...
