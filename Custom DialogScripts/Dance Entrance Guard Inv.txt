For me, it all started with a long hike and a wrong turn.
I walked through the front doors up yonder, no idea who Norwood was or anything.
By my luck, people thought I worked here, so I played along.
I'm still playing along.

Just as a warning...
People might mistake you for one of the staff.
Don't take it personally, you just have the look.  
You might want to even consider lending a helping hand.
We could use it.
Real professional operation here at the Hotel Norwood, ha!

Dottie will get you sorted at the front desk.
You'll need your reservation number handy.
Dottie will sort you out there, too.
She's good at sorting, that Dottie.

As you may have heard, DJ Bogart is back from a non-stop world tour.
It's a homecoming victory lap at his party, High End Ruminations.
I still remember when that crew had to beg for gigs.  
We eventually let those lunatics have the basement, reluctantly.
And then, boom.
It was nuts.  No one knew what they were doing.
They still don't.

I remember my first weekend here.
The office over-ordered a supply butter.
It came to us in this massive 20-foot cube.
So some of the guests started to use it as a slide.
Human bodies carving out a butter mountain.
END
DJ Bogart started High End Ruminations on a lark.
The goal was to play the weirdest music and not give a fuck.  
Little did we know it would cause this thing.

I always felt like the Board should have gifted this place to the city.
Traversing the heights of independent nodes and giggles.
Enjoy your stay, ok?

Wonderful

I find myself thinking through this whole mess and wondering.
What's the endgame?
