Yeah, I think it's time I duck out for a Blue Moose run.
	Linewaiter 2
I'll save you a place in line.  I'm falling asleep on my feet here.

	Linewaiter 2
To be honest, I don't think it tastes that great.
I just buy it because Blue Moose supports all my favorite artists.

	Linewaiter 1
Especially DJ Bogart?
	Linewaiter 2
Did you see that three-hour documentary they made on High End Ruminations?
They screened it downtown at Zoe Park last summer.  
Millions of people showed up.
	Linewaiter 1
Yeah because it was a free show and they were giving away Blue Moose.
	Linewaiter 2
Great movie, huh?
	Linewaiter 1
Dude, it was a joke.  It focused on Rufus the whole time.
	Linewaiter 2
Rufus has access to the archives.  Of course Blue Moose would reach out to him.
	Linewaiter 1
Crux 9 and Chad Blueprint weren't interviewed at all.
Those guys were there from the start.
DJ Bogart was barely in it, too.
	Linewaiter 2
You need to cut Blue Moose some slack.
Who else is going to tell the Story of High End Ruminations?
	Linewaiter 1
They told the story of Rufus
	Linewatier 2
Rufus is a visionary.
	Linewatier 1
Rufus is good at promoting himself.
Chad Blueprint was the real heart of it.
The film left a lot of questions unanswered.
	Linewaiter 2
Well, maybe if we get through tonight, you can ask DJ Bogart those questions yourself.
	Linewaiter 1
Fat chance...

Blue.
	Linewaiter 1
I was told I was too old to be bold.
So I strolled back to the fold.
And rolled me a stogie and sucked a lemon cold.
	Linewaiter 2
Fuck you.
