BEGIN
	Bruce
You’ve cornered me.  Again.
	Clem
You were experimenting with a new tactic.
	Bruce
I really needed a win tonight.  
It's been a stressful week.
Those Modulo people are too much.  
	Clem
They're still just guests for now.
You need to treat them as such.
	Bruce
They act like they already own the place.
I'm a second class citizen in their eyes.
	Clem
Ok,forget about them, just focus on the game.
	Pause 6
	Bruce
Sigh... I’d rather lose trying something new then just make the same old moves.
	Pause 3
In either case, you need to be served some humble pie.
	Clem
Maybe if you had a little help.
A little guidance...
	Bruce
Perhaps.  I do still have a few moves to make here.
BREAK
	Clem
How has it been dealing with this weekend's guests?
	Bruce
A lady from the Modulo Group ordered a turkey sandwich and complained that the bread wasn't toasted.
She also yelled at me for not including a pickle.
	Clem
When was the last time the Norwood Hotel served pickles?
	Bruce
I'll tell you when...
	Pause 6
When Peter fuckin' Norwood lived here and threw a bunch of them into the audience after every concert.
	Clem
I read about that.
	Bruce
I'll bet you did, you poncy bookworm.
	Clem
I read that he did do a lot of throwing.  Of chairs, music stands.
At his fellow musicians when they were not on their game.
	Bruce
Let's forget about Norwood for now.  I gotta focus here.
I know there's a killer move to make here somewhere... 
BREAK
	Clem
I heard the Board of Trustees vote got bumped up to tomorrow afternoon.
	Bruce
Are you kidding me?  Clem, that's it, then.  
This might be our last game.
	Clem
I remember the day I checked in to this place.
	Bruce
Yeah, I was still getting trained by Chef Ringbud. 
	Clem
Great guy, but...
	Bruce
I know, I know.
People were ordering a lot of delivery back then.
	Clem
Nadia made the right call cutting Ringbud loose.
	Bruce
I'm not sure he's doing so well now.
	Clem
You lose a job like that and it's kind of downhill from there.
	Bruce
Don't remind me, Clem.
	Clem
I'm sure you'll find something in the city.
	Bruce
We'll see...
BREAK
	Bruce
Aren't you going to miss DJ Bogart and his posse?  
	Clem
Very funny.
I welcome a weekend where my floors aren't vibrating with mindless bass.
	Bruce
You mean the mindless bass kept the Hotel running for almost a decade?
Like, singlehandedly?
	Clem
You mean my rent check didn't contribute to the ongoing financial health of this place?
I always paid on time, you know.
	Bruce
Your rent paid for the hourly fee that our lawyer charged.
To tell us our property taxes were going up.
Again.
	Clem
I did read about that in the paper.
Someone should organize a protest or something.
Community action.
	Bruce
Sure...
BREAK
	Clem
Would the Modulo Group keep you on staff?
	Bruce
Fat chance.  They have their own food service contracting arrangement.
	Clem
They wouldn't fold you in?
	Bruce
I'd have to go back to the city, re-apply for the position.
Through an agency that doesn't know me from Sandro.
Then I'd need to work my way back up, basically start over.
They probably wouldn't give me my own room, either.
	Clem
That's been a nice perk, huh?
	Bruce
Well, considering how little actual hotel business this place did, I figured why not.
	Clem
So what will you do?
	Bruce
Honestly, Clem, I have no clue.  
BREAK
	Clem
I heard Alan Miranda's going to represent the Hotel at the hearing.
	Bruce
That was cute of Nadia to hire him.
	Clem
He's very capable, you know.
	Bruce
The Modulo Group is more capable.
Even if it's Alan Miranda standing in their way.
They're going to have more money, more lawyers, more fact-finders.
	Clem
I can already see where the Modulo IT infrastructure is gonna go.
Up there on the mezzanine.
	Bruce
Some amazing Senutti games were played up there.
	Clem
Hey, Bruce, you're not out on the street yet.
	Bruce
Wanna look over my resume with me tomorrow?
	Clem
Buddy...
END
AnotherApple
	Bruce
Just testing the reality of the situation.
	Clem
Right.
Righto.
Righty-ro.
