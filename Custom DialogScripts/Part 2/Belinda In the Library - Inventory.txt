...but some forty years ago.
Peter Norwood was last seen sitting here at this very piano.
Here we have the Geiger Suite in F Minor.  
This recording is from the 1950s.
	Student 1
They recorded it here, in this room?
	Student 2
Of course, Betsy.
Didn't you watch that video Mrs. Davis sent us?
	Shano
You can actually see scuff marks from the recording equipment on the walls.
	Student 1
I don't see anything.
Can we listen to music now?
	Shano
Patience, Betsy.  You don't put on a Norwood record casually.
This is a ritual I've partaken in for a long time.
It requires preparation.
The right mood, the proper atmosphere.
	Student 2
And a record needle.
	Shano
Right... that, too.
I already asked the front desk and they're sending someone to get it for us.
	Student 1
It's been fifteen minutes.  
	Studnet 2
Clock's ticking.
	Shano
Please, patience...
BREAK
	Student 1
I want some Blue Moose.
	Student 2
They don't sell Blue Moose in the dining hall after 9pm.
	Student 1
I get unlimited waffles on Tuesdays at my dining hall.
	Shano
Both of you, please, pay attention.  
You have no idea what your advisors had to go through to get you here.
	Student 2
So can we listen to music?
	Shano
Not until we have our record needle.
	Student 1
Why don't you play something for us, Miss Davis?
There's a piano right behind you.
	Student 2
Betsy, you know Miss Davis can't right now.
	Student 1
Oh, right.  Sorry, Miss Davis.
	Shano
It's ok.  How about we just...
Wait for that needle, ok?
BREAK
	Student 2
Who's that on the wall, in the cowboy hat?	
	Shano
That's Klaus 'Claws' Burlington
	Student 1
Should I know who that is?
	Shano
Well, he was only the best cello player of his generation.
Whenever he and Norwood gave a public concert...
It caused a traffic jam from here to Yonksville.
They had to install this massive speaker system.
People would picnic throughout the grounds, listening in.
My parents even tried to go, but they could never get near it.
	Student 2
My parents have a few tapes of those shows.
	Student 1
So do mine.
	Shano
But this record I'm about to play you... it's even better.
If we can get a needle.
	Student 1
Ok...
BREAK
Norwood made sure to give credit all his collaborators.
They're looking down at us from the walls right now.
	Student 2
I don't recognize any of these people.
	Student 1
I really just care about Norwood. to be honest.
	Shano
But Betsy, Norwood couldn't have done what he did without his friends.
	Student 1
Yeah, but I'm not learning how to play oboe or cello or whatever.
After this weekend I will have fulfilled my Humanities Requirement.  
	Student 2
Betsy...
	Shano
Ladies...

BREAK
	Student 1
Mrs. Davis, can I explore this place while we wait for the needle?
	Student 2  
Can we check out downstairs?
	Shano
Absolutely not.
	Student 2
It smells like my barn.
	Shano
It's not the place for you.
	Student 1
The music coming from there is really loud.
	Shano
That music isn't for you.
The agreement is such that you stay with me the whole time.
	Student 1
Aww...
	Student 2
Ok...

I'd inquire about piano tuning here for years after school.
When Llana retired in '09, I jumped at the chance to fill her shoes.
I knew the risks, and the upfront costs.
But I really didn't care at the time.
My main job has been to tune this piano...
Along with the upright in the lobby.
I hear there's another one in The Norwood Suite.
My boss, Nadia, doesn't let anyoen up there.
I asked her if we could somehow hire movers.
To bring that piano down into the dining room.
"We can't afford it."
I asked one of the sponsors if they'd help out.
And I got laughed out of his office.
What a missed opportunity.
BREAK
	Shano
Those club goers.  
They try in vain to get down to the basement.
The bouncer turns most of them away.
In his time, Norwood didn't reject anybody. 
His concerts were open door affairs.  
This hall used to be bursting with people.
Swelling their ears with...
the most wonderfully destabalizing of note combinations.
What the hell happened, stranger?
