Well then.
Luuuke... I remember that guy.
	DC
An early attendee to DJ Bogart's modest first shows.
	BA
Indeed.
Down at the train station.
	BA
So he wants me to listen to his stuff, huh?
Look, I think I see where this is going.

Meet me up in my room.  We'll listen together.
A nice trip back to amateur night.
	DC
Nostalgia is a resource for which fools pay dearly.  
	BA
Let me take the private lift up to my room.
My underwear is all over the place, give me a minute to tidy up.
Hmmm...

Get that out of my face.  What do you really want to show me?
Cookies
I don't eat when I'm working.
Not even chocolate chip cookies.
And I'm still working.
	DC
DJ Bogart is always working.
Never eating chocolate chip cookies.
	BA
That's not always true.
I will occasionally indulge in one or two after a light meal.
	DC
A DJ Bogart knows his limits.
	BA
I mean, I'll binge after a particularly long night, but that's it.
	DC
...
	BA
So no thanks to the cookies, ok?
