Here I was about to make the big transition.
Into the song.  The BIG Song.
	DC
I was so ready for it.
	BA
Norwood's Etude No. 4.
	DC
A hidden classic.
	BA
The song that cripples every pianist who ever attempted it.
	DC
Dangerously infamous.
	BA
And I have this rare copy, see?
	DC
The only one, likely.
	BA  
People would have stopped in their tracks.
	DC
Massive.  Face-melting times had by all.
	BA
I was going to do it.
I was going to bring Norwood back.
They laugh at me now, but I was going to do it.
	DC
I will never laugh at you.
	BA
I know.
And you.  You show up and *splat*.
The vibe smooshed.  
The exoskeleton of a worthy night... crumples. 
	DC
Utterly.  
	BA
Now I'm going to have to wait until the next party.
	DC
You *are* his next party.
Right?
	BA
I am DJ Bogart.
I prefer parties that are peaceful and loving.
But when the peace is disrupted, the party has to get physical.
So... please.
Please give me a reason to change the direction of this very dull, soon-to-be very physical party.
	DC
A predictable angle demands a new vector.

It's a strange situaton when your biggest audience...
is the youth.
But such is da way of da samurai.
