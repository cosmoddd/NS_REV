DemoCD
I need you to take this, my demo CD.
The music contained on this disc is for my hero:
DJ Bogart.
It's like we discussed in the car...
DJ Bogart is spinning records at the monthly party he founded.
Like always, it's held in the Hotel Norwood basement.
The Hotel is up yonder and they'd bust me on-site if I got any further.
Give this CD to him and you'll receive the payment we agreed upon.
I've made all the necessary arrangements.  
Anything you think you need will be provided for.
Be wary, though, this is the Hotel Norwood.
Now go.  We believe in you.

Years ago, DJ Bogart said I could send him my music.
That was when he still played to a room full of three people.
I was one of them.
Me, Bernice and Jags.  
Now, he plays to thirty thousand.
Let's just say I'm finally calling in the favor.
