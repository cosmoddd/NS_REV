Where do you think they keep the Norwood Etudes?
	HT
	Mike Looks At Jeremy
	Mike
Behind glass, man.
	HT
	Dave Looks At Jeremy
	Dave
The promotors knew you wanted to get a look at the Norwood Etudes, Jer.  
	Mike
Man, you can't play that shit.  
	HT
	Mike Looks At Dave
	Mike
No one can.  
It's unusual that the promotors would put us up in a place like this.
	HT
	Dave Looks At Mike
	Dave
Yeah, they normally have us stay in barns if they'll save money.
	HT
	Jeremy Looks At Dave
	Jeremy
Remember Jane's barn?  That was pretty nice, actually.  
	HT
	Dave Looks At Jeremy
	Dave
I was forced into the shower after we got home.
	Jeremy
Tempted as I am to check out the Norwood Etudes,
I need my hands in good working order for this tour.  
I'm not making the same mistake I made at at Cubeland. 
	HT
	Mike Looks At Jeremy
	Mike
Let's leave Cubeland in the rear view.

	Dave
You know, there was an article in the Coil about Norwood a few months back.  
	HT
	Mike Looks At Dave
	Dave
Vuvos is re-issuing his discography.  Some kind of deluxe vinyl set.  
	HT
	Jeremy Looks At Mike
	Mike
That's all the Vuvos label does now.  Sell over-priced vinyl deluxe sets.
	Jeremy
Whatever they can do to help people remember Norwood, the man, though, is great.
	HT
	Dave Looks At Jeremy
People don't even know.
	Dave
Norwood lived here, right?
	HT
	Jeremy Looks At Dave
	Jeremy
He didn't just live here.
	HT
	Dave Looks At Mike
	Jeremy
This place was the center of his musical universe. 
	HT 
	Mike Looks At Jeremy
	Jeremy
Piano Works VII and VIII were written for him here.
	HT
	Mike Looks At Dave
	Jeremy
Xenokos was living here for a few summers.  Nobody knows that.
But there's a picture of him on the wall. 
	HT
	Jeremy Looks At Mike
	Dave
We should see if they'll let us rehearse in his auditorium.
No one uses it any more.
	HT 
	Dave Looks At Jeremy
	Dave
What happened to Norwood, anyway?
	HT
	Jeremy Looks At Dave
	Jeremy
Vanished. In '73.  
He had already withdrawn from performing a year earlier.
Then he was gone.
	HT
	Mike Looks At Dave
	Jeremy
No note, no clues, nothing.
	HT
	Mike Looks At Jeremy
	Mike
That's it?
	HT
	Jeremy Looks At Mike
	Jeremy
It was a big unsolved mystery in its day.
Plenty of theories, no hard evidence.
	HT
	Dave Looks At Mike
	Dave
Well, whatever happened forty years ago, nobody really cares now.
	HT
	Jeremy Looks At Dave
	Jeremy
As you can see, this place has been kept in 'historical condition.'
	HT
	Dave Looks At Jeremy
	HT
	Jeremy Looks At Mike
	Mike
Yeah, they never renovated and it looks like it.
	HT
	Dave Looks At Mike
	Dave
I hear the pool is warm.  I'm heading there tomorrow.
	Jeremy
Before rehearsal, of course.
	HT
	Dave Looks At Jeremy

	Jeremy Looks At Dave
	HT
	Mike Looks At Dave
	Dave
Of course, dude.  I never miss rehearsal.
	HT
	Mike Looks At Dave
	Mike
I'm gonna make field recordings in the woods.

Impressive moves from the stranger.
	Jeremy
Indeed.
	Mike
Wish I could say the same...
