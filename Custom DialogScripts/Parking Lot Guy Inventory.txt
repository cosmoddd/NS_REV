That's a ripe apple.
Great.
Apple
	Cowboy
The Apples stocked in the Norwood Pantry are called 'elder rambos.'
Subtle sweetness with a slightly bitter aftertaste.
Good for pies and to add apple flavoring to cool water.
Just don't ask Bruce, our chef, to make you an apple crumble.
It will probably crumble before it reaches your mouth.

Admirers of Norwood say he was a collector.
Detractors say he was a hoarder.
We've had antique dealers come through over the years.
In hopes that we can sell some of Norwood's curios.
Their offers are always too low for Nadia.
Now I fear that income stream has flowed away from us for good.

Helmets are for the meek.
But where's your bike, anyway?
Or is that your costume for DJ Bogart's party?

BlueMoose
	Cowboy
I used to have Blue Moose and scotch every morning.
Now I feel twice as old as I am.
Seems like a perk, having endless cans of the stuff around.
What I wouldn't give for a grapefruit juice right now.

ParkingPermit
	Cowboy
Nothing excites me more than a trip to the lamination machine.
Look, seeing as you don't have a car...
You might as well give that back to Dottie when you see her.
Actually, I'll take it.

Man...
Oh man...
This job is a drag.
LOOP CONTROL
Wonderful

SwitchboxKey
	Cowboy
Look, if you want to go opening that control box by the Singing Faces, knock yourself out.
I don't even remember what got left in there.
There was a mechanism in there.  Luigi Zee designed it, even.
Norwood used the mechanism so he could 'tune' the tones that emanated from the Faces.
Every week he'd have a different chord progression prepared for guests...
as they drove up the hill.
The mechanism's long gone.  Vandals, probably.
