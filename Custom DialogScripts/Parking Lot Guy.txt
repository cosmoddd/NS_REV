This party tonight, downstairs in the hotel basement.
"High End Ruminations."
DJ Bogart back from his grand tour.
I still remember when he had to beg for gigs.
The only place that would take him was the Hotel Norwood.
They'd already laughed him out of the city.
Funny what a difference a few years makes.

You might want to get yourself settled before going, though.
Dottie will help you check in.
Just as a warning...
People might mistake you for one of the staff.
Don't take it personally, you just have the look.  
You might want to even consider lending a helping hand.
We could use it.
Real professional operation here at the Hotel Norwood, ha!
BREAK

For me, it all started with a long hike and a wrong turn.
I walked through the front doors up yonder, no idea who Norwood was or anything.
By my luck, people thought I worked here, so I played along.
I'm still playing along.

I remember my first weekend here.
The office over-ordered a supply butter.
It came to us in this massive 20-foot cube.
So some of the guests started to use it as a slide.
Human bodies carving out a butter mountain.
END

High End Ruminations started as a joke.
The goal was to play the weirdest music and not give a fuck.  
Little did we know it would cause this thing.

I always felt like the Board should have gifted this place to the city.
Traversing the heights of independent nodes and giggles.
Enjoy your stay, ok?
END
Wonderful
	Cowboy
I find myself thinking through this whole mess and wondering.
What's the endgame?

Nothing excites me more than a trip to the lamination machine.
Look, seeing as you don't have a car...
You might as well give that back to Dottie when you see her.
Actually, I'll take it.
