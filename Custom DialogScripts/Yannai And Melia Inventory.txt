It will once I douse it in Hova's Hollandaise.
	Melia
You really like to add more flavor to everything, don't you?
	Yannai
Everything is bland without sauce.  
	Melia
You think your tastebuds might be overworked?
	Yannai
I think everyone elses' need to awaken to new flavors.
	Melia
I'll think on that.

We'd like to order a sandwhich.
Turkey, mozzarella cheese.
Chef Bruce decided to check out a few hours ago.

Do us a favor and pick up the slack.
This meeting tomorrow is way too stressful without a good, Hotel Norwood Sandwich Supreme.

You work up an appetite when preparing a deposition against Alan Miranda.
	Yannai
He's the only reason we're here at all.  
Otherwise, this property acquisition would've been a done deal last month.

Just so we're clear, we can't confirm or deny whether current staff will remain in place after the acquisition..
	Yannai
You may have heard of Modulo Group's Zero Redundancy Policy.
So we're encouraging all current staff make themselves extra useful as we prepare for the management transition.
	Melia
Useful like Bruce is useful?
ALL
Chewy pizza, tubby steak...
Gloopy ramen, soft boiled hot dogs...

Are you getting hungry, Michelle?
	Melia
Yeah.  I could use a sandwich.
	Yannai
Why don't you do us a favor and get us a sandwich?
	Melia
Yeah, I think as guests we can get sandwiches made at all hours.

Yeah...

Probably a few more books to look up before I call it a night.

You know I brought some special hotsauce for the sandwich.
	Melia
Hova's Hollandaise?

It says it's made with 'natural' ingredients.
	Yannai
I taste the naturalness.
	Melia
You usually beleive what you read on a can?
	Yannai
The can's so small, it can't hurt me.
	Melia
I've seen you fit four at a time in your glove compartment. 
	Yannai
One for each meal, plus one for fun.
	Melia
I'm surprised you don't have a condition.
	Yannai
My parents lived on an artist's farm out in Blatsby.  
They made their own tempeh.
Experimented with all kinds of flavors and combos.
Most meals I didn't have a choice.
As soon as I went off to college, it was Stew Glennards' ice cream every day.
	Melia
And now it's Blue Moose meal?
	Yannai
And between meals.
	Melia
Have you gotten yourself checked out by Dr. McTavish?
	Yannai
Jane keeps saying I can ingest Blue Moose whenever I want.  
As long as I keep up my work regimen.
	Melia
Is that so...
