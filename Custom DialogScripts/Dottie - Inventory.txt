Oh, wow, I haven't seen one of those in a while.
	//Sandro looks at You
	//Sandro
Yeah, no one comes here for the Spa Treatment anymore.
	//Dottie
Such a shame Nadia had to let the masseuse go.
	//Sandro looks at Dottie
	//Sandro
You really liked him, didn't you?
	//Dottie looks at Sandro
	//Dottie
I liked how he worked my lower lumbar.
	//Sandro
Hold on... when was the last time we cleaned out the lockers?
	//Dottie
Years.
	//Sandro looks at You
	//Sandro
Stranger, if you find anything in the lockers, we apologize.
	//Dottie looks at You
	//Dottie
It's just... an unusual request, coming for a spa treatment.
No matter.

	//Sandro
Here's the key one of the lockers.
I'm not sure what you'll find in there.
	//Dottie
Probably just a towel and some sandals.
	//Sandro
Sorry, no masseuse.
	//Dottie
You get what you pay for...

Strange... I didn't notice you store luggage with us before...
	//Dottie looks at Sandro
	//Dottie
What does it matter?  
	//Sandro looks at Dottie
	//Sandro
Remember how Nadia lectured us on all the theft reports we've been getting?
	//Dottie looks at Sandro
	//Dottie
I must have slept through that lecture.
Besides, most of that stuff's probably turned up in the Lost and Found.
	//Sandro
Right...

	//Dottie
So you wanna get that demo CD to DJ Bogart, eh?
	//Sandro looks at Dottie
	//Sandro
Quite bold of you.
Good luck getting through to DJ Bogart.
He's reaching peak hour down in the basement right now.
	//Dottie
It's a homecoming show for him.
	//Sandro
He launched his career here, after all.

	//Sandro looks at You
	//Dottie
I had one of those about an hour ago.
	//Sandro
It's funny when there's this unlimited supply of something.
You just... develop a taste for it.
	//Dottie
It's inevitable, in a place like this.
	//Sandro looks at Dottie
	//Sandro
Did you know that the Blue Moose endorsement comprises 63% of our yearly income?
	//Dottie looks at Sandro
	//Dottie
Did Nadia tell you that?
	//Sandro
Nadia wouldn't tell me if there was a snake in my bed.
But she did leave her ledger out last week.
	//Dottie
No she didn't.
	//Sandro
I had to look.
	//Dottie
So it's that bad, huh?
	//Sandro
To be honest, most of the the accounting was indecipherable.
	//Dottie
Was there more red ink on the page or black?
	//Sandro
There was black ink, red ink.
Glitter stickers and rainbows drawn in marker.
Pictures of pop stars, glued in the margins.
	//Dottie
Ok, I'm glad I didn't see it.  
Just as long as that Blue Moose money keeps flowing our way.
	//Sandro
63%.  Every sip is another 30 bucks in your pocket.
	//Dottie
For now.
	//Sandro
For now...

I could go for a warm slice of apple pie right now.
	//Sandro looks at Dottie
With a side of vanilla ice cream.
	//Dottie looks at Sandro
	//Dottie
I could go for a cold spoonful of apple sauce.
With a dram o'whiskey.
	//Sandro
*sigh*
