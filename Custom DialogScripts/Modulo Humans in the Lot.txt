	Human 2
Congratulations on your promotion, Lucy.
	Human 1
Oh, thanks.  I honestly didn't see it coming.
	Human 2
That's the third one in the last, what, two years?
	Human 1
I'm not really doing anything that remarkable.
	Human 2
Naako would disagree.
	Human 1
Oh, that Naako.
	Human 2
Really, he can't stop singing your praises at meetings.
	Human 1
Well, I gotta hand it to my team of assistants.
	Human 2
Your assistants aren't getting the pay raise you are.
	Human 1
Their turn is coming.  
	Human 2
Maybe it's come already.
	Human 1
I can't do it without them.
	Human 2
Would you like to re-distribute your raise so they get a share?  
	Human 1
Oh, absolutely not.
	Human 2
Then accept my congratulations and have a drink with me.
	Human 1
Fine, but I don't drink.
	Human 2
Lucy, look where we are.
Blue Moose keeps there entire east coast stock here, pretty much.
	Human 1
Well, I could use that to take the edge off before tomorrow's conference.
	Human 2
Please.  Alan Miranda's got nothing on our team.
	Human 1
I feel like we're still overlooking some crucial detail.
And Miranda's going to pounce on it.
	Human 2
Let me put you at ease, Lucy:
I've been staying here the last several weekends.
Drafting sketches, taking several meetings with Nadia.
I even got to influence the make-up of the panel.
	Human 1
Isn't that... a bit underhanded?
	Human 2
Everyone has their price, Lucy.
	Human 1
Oh?
	Human 2
Everyone.
	Human 1
Now I really need some of that Blue Moose.
