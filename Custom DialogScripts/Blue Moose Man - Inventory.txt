//Blue Moose Man stares out the window

My stylist would probably not approve of that necklace.
But my mother would.

That would look good in my fitness room.
Above the 40-inch screen.
I already have a mock-bust of an ancient athlete, though.
So I think we're covered there.
END
TheNorwoodEtudes
	BlueMan
I get that certain people still want to promote Norwood, the man.
DJ Bogart name-checks him whenever he can.
But he doesn't easily fit into our marketing narrative.
Which we've carefully constructed around the High End Ruminations party.
Our client base don't know who he is.
Their parents barely remember him.
So this book... it's giving me cognative dissonance. 
Please put it away.
END
TheNorwoodSuiteKey
	BlueMan
When I was young I used keys.
But now it's all number pads and finger ID scans for me.
END
NorwoodsMonocle
	BlueMan
My sight may not be 20/20
But my phone's text-to-speech program is flawless.
So you can keep that relic.

	BlueMan
They let me have a bungalow room.
Directly underneath us.
Much quieter.
END
LuggageTag
	BlueMan
I don't travel with any luggage.
I've downsized quite a lot over the past year.
But if I wanted it back again I could just re-buy it.
END
CostumeShoes
	BlueMan
My assistant is one of the best shoe lace tie-ers in the business.
Five seconds, no double-knots, perfectly in place all day.
Though I do slip-ons whenever possible.
END
KeyLockerModulo
	BlueMan
A man wiser than myself once said:
It's easier to remember key combinations...
...than to remember where you left your keys.
But here's what he didn't say:
It's even easier to remember the universal reset combination.
END
MozzarellaBall
	BlueMan
The Hotel Norwood is not known for it's high sanitation standards.
So I'd best be mindful where that cheese has been.
Just saying...
END
LargeTomato
	BlueMan
One of the flavor lab guys came up with a tomato flavor of Blue Moose.
Think V-9 with a tart, slightly bitter aftertaste. 
Made it all the way to the top of product development.
But our president, my boss, said his wife didn't like it.
So we killed it.
A shame, as it could have been a big seller.
END
DemoCD
	BlueMan
So you want to give that demo CD to DJ Bogart, eh?
I guess it's worth a shot.
These big DJs, they still listen to everything.
Even the bad stuff, sight unseen.
Because they know that there's bound to be a gem amongst rocks.
And then they can take all the credit.
So, best of luck.
END
ParkingPermit
	BlueMan
Thankfully, that's not even an issue for me.
My driver, she's very fast, somehow never gets pulled over.
She got me from downtown to here in under an hour, and in traffic.
END
SpaVoucher
	BlueMan
Because BlueMoose's arrangement with the hotel, I get free spa treatments.
Unfortunately Nadia, in her infinite wisdom, fired Shirley last year.
Maybe for the best, as Shirley gave such tubby backrubs imaginable.
Deeply underwhelming.
But then again, I'm doing Catherine wheel treatments, so my pain threshold is pretty high.

BlankSheetMusic
	BlueMan
For Blue Moose Energy Drinks, it's not just about the notes on the page.
It's about the community that coalesces around those notes.
And how those notes inspire that community to breathe and writhe.
Top-selling bands beg us to use their music in our ad campaigns.
But do they think us amateurs? 
The idea of bottom-up marketing through forming narratives around real scenes.
And giving those scenes something to drink...  
We got there first.
Brand recognition through real, deep community integration.
Consider our relationship with High End Ruminations and Hotel Norwood as Exhibit A.  
END
TheSandwich
	BlueMan
Please...
I'm keenly aware of how perishables get handled around here.
I'm proud to say our product can keep for up to ten years.
Hot, room or cold temperatures.
If you're stocking your fallout shelter, Blue Moose and canned beans are a perfect combo.
END
BookOfZo
	BlueMan
I bounce right off games like Zo.
Just blocks and shapes, no theme. 
Wake me up when it's over.
END
SwitchboxKey
	BlueMan
We use universal keycards and iris scans at the company HQ.
Put that antiquated unlocking technology away, it sort-of offends me.
END
LockerKey2
	BlueMan
At home I have a safe that's unlocked using water pressure and a heart monitor.
I look at an old-fashioned key like that and I laugh.
END
Apple
	BlueMan
Our flavor specialists would say apple is a good direction for a spin-off flavor.
Our marketing team would say it reminds them too much of thier childhood lunchbox.
So we arrive at an impasse.
END

That's something my great-uncle would wear to his social club.
Only this doesn't reek of cigar smoke.  
END
OldBook
	BlueMan
Listen, I read Advertiser's Quarterly, Traveller's Quarterly, and the Tentpole.
And my aggregated socials feed, naturally.
Anything else is unnecessary.

Pretzels and pretzel-related foods cause uncontrollabe excitement.  
It's a known fact.

I already have a driver.
I don't need a lift anywhere.
Not this weekend, anyways.

FaceMask
	BlueMan
Our company helped break High End Ruminations wide, alongside DJ Bogart.
With that in mind, I'd rather they know it's really me on the dancefloor.

That's probably the last thing I need in my life right now.

I'll have you read that to me before bedtime sometime.

RecordNeedle
	BlueMan
My record player only takes a proprietary D93 cartridge.
It's wildly overpriced but the dealer told me it would sound the best.
I find myself breaking out my card reflexivly.
Nice problem to have, I guess.
END
KeyWineLocker2
	BlueMan
Not everything needs to be locked away, you know.
The more physical objects we share, the more we realize we don't need them.
I don't own Blue Moose anymore than you do.
Once it's in your mouth, it's yours.
It's your taste buds, your imbibing experience.
The key to your mouth is through your mind.
END
TurkeyHunk
	BlueMan
One day I'll live on a turkey farm north of Plattsburg.
It's a dream I've had since before my start in the beverage industry.
What I'll do there, I have no idea.
But turkeys are peaceful birds.
And turkey egg omelletes are underrated.
END
Motorcyle_Helmet_2
	BlueMan
Someone else seeks the thrills of speed and derring-do, not me.
I prefer the thrills of line graphs and bar charts, rising and falling. 
Those I'll ride with my eyes and mind, anytime.

A key opens doors.
A key phrase opens minds.

A busines rival once said I should grow out my mustache and twirl it.
Needless to say, he's no longer at the company and I got promoted.
Many times over.

Why don't you go grab some of that Pluny the Younger.
Such a good pour.
I promise you'll have free Blue Moose for a year.
I'll be down by the jacuzzi.

Thanks so much, I really need a swim.
I usually don't go down there without my favorite beverage.
And no, it's not what you're thinking.
I keep a case of Pluny the Older in my private chiller in the kitchen.
I get it hand-delivered from the west coast in an ice-box.
